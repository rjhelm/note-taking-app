## Description

This is a note taking app that utilizes node and express to create notes that can be stored on a server, this allows the user to create notes, save the notes, and delete when the notes are no longer needed. This is all done on the server side because it was built using express.

This shows the application deployed on a live server with the stored notes on the left hand side. The code was written so that notes can be edited and saved, once saved they are given a unique id so that they are stored on the server and can be deleted when the user is done with the note. The unique id for the note is identified and the note is deleted based on those parameters, the json file is then updated so that the note data is removed and notes will load with the updated correct notes.
